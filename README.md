# Vim Snippets

This is my collection of [Vim][] snippets, for use with [Ultisnips][].

Their original home was in [my dotfiles][] before I extracted them out into
this repository. I still use [rcm][] to symlink my `.vim` directory to the
snippets, which requires the top-level `vim` directory here.

Trigger words for snippets are typically short words or mnemonics (see
[`honza/vim-snippets`][]), but many of mine tend to be whole words or phrases,
since I use them primarily with [Plover][] stenography (see
[my stenography dictionaries][]), which enables that easily.

## Videos

You can see the snippets in action during the following videos:
